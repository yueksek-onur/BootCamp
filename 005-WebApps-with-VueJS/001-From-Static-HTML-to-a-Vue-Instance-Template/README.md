# Task: From static HTML to a Vue Instance

In this task we use the basics of template interpolation.

Fulfill the following tasks:

- [x] Don't start from scratch. Use the provided resources in the `src` folder of this coding task.
- [x] Add Vue 3 from a CDN
- [x] Create a Vue Instance and mount it
- [x] The persons name **John Doe** should be located as a data property in the Vue Instance
- [x] Use text interpolation to display the persons name
- [x] Replace **1/24/2022, 12:34:25 PM** with the current date and time by using a javascript expression. Take care of the en-us format. See also [toLocaleString](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString) to solve this.
