# Kata: LinkedIn Contacts

You will rebuild the suggested contacts widget of LinkedIn.

- [ ] Use this API: https://dummy-apis.netlify.app/api/contact-suggestions?count=1
- [ ] Show 8 suggested contacts by default
- [ ] If you click the close / remove button on a suggested contact the contact is removed and ad new suggestion is added to the end of the suggestion panel
- [ ] The connect feature should be (dummy) implemented (you do not actually connect with anyone) in the browser - no api calls required
- [ ] The number of pending requests should be persisted between browser sessions
- [ ] If you click the "Connect" button the number of pending invitation changes and the text of the button changes to "Pending"
- [ ] If you click the "Pending" button it should switch back to "Connect" and the number of pending invitations should be decreased
- [ ] While LinkedIn shows the number of connections OR the company name you should always show the number of mutual connections
